# RiSC16-Assembler
(In development)

Documentation on the architecture can be found here: https://www.ece.umd.edu/~blj/RiSC/

In this project, I plan on building an assembler for the RiSC 16-bit architecture. My goal for it is to be a kind of command-line compiler like GCC or Clang, but obviously with limited functionality.

Because of school, developement will be going relatively slowly.

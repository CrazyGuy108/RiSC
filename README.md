# RiSC16-Assembler
(In development)

Documentation on the architecture can be found here: https://www.ece.umd.edu/~blj/RiSC/

In this project, I plan on building an assembler and emulator for the RiSC 16-bit architecture. Because the system architecture was never finished, I also plan on making my own, generally by taking MIPS(the architecture this was based off of) and shrinking it down to 16-bit.

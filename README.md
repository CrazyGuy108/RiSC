# RiSC
This is a project based on prof. Bruce Jacob's Ridiculously Simple Computer (which can be found [here](https://www.ece.umd.edu/~blj/RiSC/)), which I've implemented as a slightly buggy assembler and emulator written in C++.

## Things I learned
I watched [Compilers with Alex Aiken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm0QQO-WZlM) on youtube until I realized that an assembler for something like RiSC is too simple for something like an LL(1) parser. It also got me into learning how parsers work in general, as well as a bit of the code generation process that goes on.
